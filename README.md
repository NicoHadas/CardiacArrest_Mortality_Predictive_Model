# Predictive Model for ICU Cardiac Arrest Mortality

## Overview
This repository provides code and relevant documentation for building a predictive model to assess in-hospital mortality risk for ICU patients with cardiac arrest (CA). The model uses data from **MIMIC-IV** and **Phecodes** to identify key predictors and potentially improve patient outcomes.

---

## Data Sources
- **MIMIC-IV**:
  A large, open-access electronic health record database containing ICU patient data from 2008â€“2019. MIMIC-IV includes demographics, vital signs, lab tests, diagnoses, and clinical outcomes.
  *Access to MIMIC-IV is restricted and requires credentialing via PhysioNet. Users must complete the CITI "Data or Specimens Only Research" course and sign a data use agreement. More information can be found [here](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/).*
- **Phecodes**:
  A curated collection of ICD code groupings used to consolidate clinically relevant diagnoses.

## Methods Summary

Predictive model (XGBoost) developed for in-hospital mortality in ICU patients with cardiac arrest (CA).

1.  **Cohort Selection**: The initial MIMIC-IV cohort (299,712 patients) was filtered to identify ICU patients with a cardiac arrest diagnosis using Phecode 427.42. Only the first ICU admission was considered, yielding 1,917 unique patients. The `hospital_expire_flag` from the `admissions` table served as the binary outcome variable.
2.  **Feature Engineering**:
    * **Comorbidities**: COPD (Phecode 496), hypertension (Phecode 401.1), and diabetes mellitus (Phecode 250.2) were extracted.
    * **Demographics**: Age and gender were included.
    * **Clinical Scores**: SAPS II, SOFA (24-hour), and GCS scores were incorporated from the MIMIC-IV derived schema (extracted using MIMIC-IV SQL code).
    * **Labs and Vitals (First 12 Hours of ICU Stay)**: Mean values for 18 parameters (BMI, Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, O2 Saturation, Anion Gap, Temperature, Hemoglobin, Prothrombin Time, Systolic & Diastolic Blood Pressure, Hematocrit, Platelet Count, Glucose, Potassium, Chloride, Sodium, Creatinine, WBC) were extracted from `chartevents`.
3.  **Data Preprocessing**: Utilized PostgreSQL for initial data loading and Python (pandas) for processing. Six outliers identified via boxplots were removed. Patients with more than two missing features (>7.5% of total features) were also excluded, leaving a final analytical cohort of 1,805 patients.
4.  **Modeling**:
    * An XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) classifier was employed.
    * The dataset was split into 70% training and 30% testing sets.
    * Hyperparameters (n\_estimators, max\_depth, learning\_rate, subsample, colsample\_bytree) were optimized using a grid search with 3-fold cross-validation.
5.  **Evaluation**: Model performance was assessed via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, a confusion matrix, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC). Feature importance was determined using XGBoost's F-score and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values.

## Results Summary

The hypertuned XGBoost model demonstrated moderate performance in predicting in-hospital mortality.

* **Key Performance Metrics (Test Set)**:
    * Accuracy: 0.679
    * Precision (for mortality): 0.66
    * Recall (for mortality): 0.62
    * F1-score (for mortality): 0.66 
    * Area Under ROC Curve (AUC): 0.77
* **Significant Predictors**:
    * **SHAP Analysis**: SAPS II (higher scores strongly associated with mortality), lower Temperature, and higher Prothrombin time were identified as the most impactful features.
    * **XGBoost F-score**: Temperature, BMI, and Prothrombin time were among the top-ranked features by importance.

The model, with an AUC of 0.77, shows a moderate capability in discriminating between patients who will survive and those who will not, and highlights clinically relevant factors associated with mortality in ICU cardiac arrest patients.
