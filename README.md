## Overview  
This repository provides code, documentation, and resources for building a **predictive model** to assess in-hospital mortality risk for ICU patients with cardiac arrest (CA). The model leverages data from **MIMIC-IV** and **Phecodes** to identify key predictors, support clinical decision-making, and enhance patient outcomes.

## Data Sources  
- **MIMIC-IV**:  
  A large, open-access electronic health record database containing ICU patient data from 2008â€“2019. MIMIC-IV includes demographics, vital signs, lab tests, diagnoses, and clinical outcomes, making it a valuable resource for predictive modeling.  
- **Phecodes**:  
  A curated collection of ICD code groupings used to consolidate clinically relevant diagnoses. In this project, Phecodes will help identify CA-related phenotypes by mapping ICD-10 codes from MIMIC-IV into more meaningful clusters.

## Key Deliverables  
- Code for model training, testing, and evaluation  
- Documentation detailing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation  
- Insights into significant predictors and their clinical relevance
